## Why are you wondering what is the difference between Ajax search and traditional search?

1- Traditional Search:
- Traditional search typically involves submitting a form and reloading the page to display the search results. Here's how it usually works:

- User enters a search query in a search input field.
- User clicks a "Search" button or presses Enter to submit the form.
- The browser sends a request to the server, which processes the search query.
- The server performs the necessary search operations, retrieves the results from a database or other data source, and generates a new page with the search results.
- The server sends the generated page back to the browser, and the browser reloads the entire page to display the results.
- Traditional search is a straightforward approach and suitable for simple search functionalities. However, it may result in a slower user experience due to the page reloads.

2- AJAX Search:
- AJAX (Asynchronous JavaScript and XML) search allows for searching without reloading the entire page. It provides a more dynamic and responsive user experience. Here's how it typically works:

- User enters a search query in a search input field.
- As the user types, JavaScript code attached to the input field detects the changes and sends an asynchronous request to the server.
- The server processes the search query and retrieves the search results.
- The server sends back a response (usually in JSON or XML format) containing the search results.
- JavaScript code on the client-side receives the response and updates the search results on the page dynamically, without reloading the entire page.
- AJAX search offers several advantages, such as faster response times, a smoother user experience,

- **Create traditional Search**

1- Define a route that handles the search request

2- Create a controller named SearchController

```
  public function search(Request $request)
    {
        $search = $request->input('search');

        // Perform the search query using your model
        $results = ModelName::where('Search_name', 'like', '%' . $search . '%')->get();

        return view('page_name', compact('results'));
    }

```
3- Create a search form in your view file

4- In your view file, you can display the search results
5- By following these steps, you can create a traditional search
